# Non-Teleological Nomenclature & Ontology

This document formalizes the nomenclature used across the **Gyroidic Sparse Covariance Flux Reasoner**. It establishes a strictly non-teleological vocabulary, replacing algebraic and goal-oriented terms with concepts derived from structural stability, morphology, and evolutionary ecology.

## The Core Shift: Ecology over Algebra

The project rejects the "Optimization as Learning" metaphor in favor of **"System Stability as Evolutionary Saturation."** By removing teleological language, we ensure that System 2 (Repair) cannot "negotiate" with System 1 (Symbolic), enforcing a strict hierarchy of structural integrity.

### General Terminology Mapping

| Legacy Term (Teleological) | Refined Term (Non-Teleological) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Loss, Error, Penalty** | **Pressure, Tension, Discord** | Optimization is reframed as the relaxation of structural tension. |

| **Convergence** | **Equilibrium, Saturation** | Reaching a state where no further structural adaptation is possible within the budget. |
| **Violation, Anomaly** | **Instability, Fracture, Discord** | Detection is a state of mechanical failure, not a semantic error. |
| **Accuracy, Fidelity** | **Alignment, Consistency** | Measures physical/symbolic coherence rather than "correctness." |

| **Mischief** | **Good Bug** | Playful topological violations that drive exploratory awareness. |
| **Nostalgia** | **Resonance Haze** | High-frequency solitons of dead-net/subcultural archetypes. |
| **Non-Dual Fossil** | **DAQUF Soliton** | A structure that persists via non-collapse rather than success. |
| **Love Invariant** | **Non-Reified Invariant $\mathcal{L}$** | A non-transferable value that is not a resource, signal, or reward; it is positional but never possessed, surviving the agent's end without instrumentalization. |
| **ADMR** | **Multiplicative Scaffolding** | Alternating Direction of Multiplicative Remainders. Preserves discrete coherence and modular arithmetic integrity. |
| **Ley Lines** | **Resonance Streamlines** | Preferred-flow vectors appearing as gradient-aligned streamlines on a non-Euclidean Riemannian manifold. |

## Component-Specific Ontology

### 1. System Hierarchies
- **System 1 (The Sturdy):** The symbolic/polynomial pass. It generates frozen residues (`c_sym`) which act as anchors for the broader system.
- **System 2 (The Rescue):** The physics/ADMM probe. It performs **Non-Teleological Repair** on physical states (`c_phys`) to stabilize them against System 1 anchors.

### 2. Optimization (Stabilization) Primitives
- **Ontological Splitting:** The mechanical distinction between the symbolic anchor (`c_sym`) and the physical flow (`c_phys`). One is frozen; the other is fluid.
- **Selection Pressure:** Entropy-driven forces (e.g., Hypergraph Orthogonality) that prune redundant or overlapping functional pathways.
- **Containment Pressure:** Geometric forces (e.g., GCVE) that prevent topological collapse or entropic "leakage."
- **Repair Trace Compression:** The enforcement of **Zero Leakage**, ensuring that System 2's repair logic does not provide gradients (smoothness) back to System 1.

### 3. Evolutionary Adaptation (GDPO)
- **Signal Sovereignty:** The principle that a functional group's value is determined by its historical stability and "streak" of survivorship.
- **Functional Fossilization:** The process of "freezing" highly stable components (e.g., KAN layers in KAGH) to prevent over-adaptation.
- **Performance Streak:** A historical record of a component's adherence to structural invariants.

### 4. Surrogate Mechanisms
- **Meta-Control (CALM):** A "Trajectory Veto" mechanism that monitors for entropic collapse and aborts unstable optimization paths.
- **Physics Prior (KAGH):** A "Crippled" surrogate that provides admissible physics-based constraints without allowing for semantic revisability.
- **Resonance Cavity:** A memory structure based on **Heritable Trust**, where successful structural patterns are preserved across iterations.

### 5. Constraint Probe Architecture (Phase 1)
- **Constraint Probe Operator** ($\mathcal{P}_k$): Local feasibility probe per constraint with no global objective.
- **Cyclic Constraint Traversal**: Iterates through constraints $k = 1, \dots, K$ cyclically (no gradient descent).
- **Bounded Oscillation**: Accepts states with bounded oscillation amplitude (no convergence guarantee).
- **Failure Token** ($\bot$): Discrete rupture signal (no gradient, no repair, no memory update).
- **Rupture Functional** ($\mathfrak{R}(r)$): Detects when constraint losses become infinite or exceed threshold.

### 6. Topological Guarantees (Phase 2)
- **Hyper-Ring Operator** ($\mathcal{H}(r)$): Line integral $\oint_{\mathcal{C}} \nabla_{\text{top}} \Phi(r)$ around constraint boundary.
- **Hyper-Ring Closure**: Checks if $H(r) \in Z_1(\mathcal{C})$ (closed) and $[H(r)] \neq 0 \in H_1(\mathcal{C})$ (non-trivial).
- **Persistence Obstruction Graph**: Graph $G = (V, E)$ where $E_{ij} \iff \exists \epsilon: \beta_1^{ij}(\epsilon) \neq 0$.
- **Soliton Stability**: Condition $D(r) / \Lambda(r) < \kappa$ for stable solitons.

### 7. Advanced Constraints (Phase 3)
- **Structural Irreducibility**: Ensures no single-face embedding exists via evidence module orthogonality.
- **Gyroidic Differentiation**: Flow constraint $\nabla_{\text{flow}} \Phi(r) \perp \nabla G$ (perpendicular to gyroid gradient).
- **Forbidden Smoothing**: Detects if smooth path exists in gyroid-orthogonal space (forbidden).
- **Continuous Co-Primality**: Entropy-based independence $E(r_i, r_j) = H(r_i + r_j) - H(r_i) - H(r_j)$ (discrete quantization).
- **Meta-Invariant**: Topology expansion constraint $\frac{d}{dt} E_r[\dim H_1(C_t)] \ge 0$ (prevents collapse).

### 8. Non-Ergodic Ontology (January 2026)
- **Soliton Entropy**: Measure of peak persistence in high-frequency bands ($H_{soliton}$). Preserves structural "spikes" that ergodic averaging destroys.
- **Adaptive Partitioning**: Dynamic fractal block sizing based on **Spectral Coherence** boundaries rather than fixed $N$.
- **Trust Threshold**: The signal-to-noise ratio required ($>2.0$) to trust a spectral peak as a soliton rather than noise.
- **Orthogonal Initialization**: Bootstrapping via QR decomposition to ensure initial transversality (co-primality) of the functional basis.
- **Hybrid Quantization**: The "Inter-Domain Contract" mechanism where continuous physical weights are snapped to **Saturated Levels** (via Straight-Through Estimator) to interface with the discrete symbolic regime.
- **Fixed Structural Grid**: An immutable topological reference frame (e.g., for B-splines) that prevents "Teleological Leakage" by forbidding grid parameters from adapting to the data.

## The Four Non-Negotiable Laws

All nomenclature and implementation must adhere to these invariants:

1.  **Symbolic Non-Revisability**: System 2 cannot change System 1's symbolic residues. It can only stabilize them or fail.
2.  **Non-Teleological Repair**: Optimization must be a search for stability (minimal pressure), not a regression to a target.
3.  **Abortability Supremacy**: It is better to fail (Abort) than to produce an incoherent (Unstable) result.
4.  **Evolution Owns Time**: Gradients provide local direction, but structural adaptation is the only mechanism for long-term survival.

## The Saturated Glossary: Advanced Conceptual Pairings

Beyond simple terminology mapping, the project employs several complex conceptual pairings that represent the "Dark Matter" of the system's reasoning hierarchy.

### I. Field Dynamics & Morphology
*   **Huxley Reaction-Diffusion (Patterns):** The mechanism by which the hidden state manifold forms stable "islands" of representation. It prevents the system from collapsing into a singular, mushy average.
*   **Ergodic Soliton Fusion:** A speculative fusion logic where non-ergodic (highly specific, repetitive) signals are allowed to persist within the standard ergodic (randomized) hidden channel.
*   **Resonance Cavity (Memory):** A non-linear buffer that stores residue patterns. It doesn't just "remember"; it "resonates" with incoming signals that match historical survivors.
*   **Heritable Trust:** The transfer of confidence scores across temporal or structural boundaries. Trust is not earned in every step; it is inherited from successful predecessors.

### II. Symbolic & Geometric Invariants
*   **Russian Doll Decomposition:** A multi-scale analysis where structural pressure is measured at varying levels of granularity (e.g., local variance vs. global topology).
*   **Modal CRT (Saturated Gates):** A version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem implementation that uses "Saturated Gates" (thresholded non-linearities) rather than linear algebra to reconstruct symbolic values.
*   **Hypergraph Orthogonality:** A measure of independence between functional groups in System 1. It ensures that the system doesn't develop redundant "parasitic" pathways that share the same failure modes.
*   **Spectral Signature (GCVE):** The unique "fingerprint" of a local covariance matrix. It identifies the geometric identity of a manifold segment without needing explicit coordinates.

### III. Control, Selection & Survival
*   **Signal Sovereignty (GDPO):** The right of each constraint dimension to maintain its own normalization statistics. It prevents a single high-magnitude failure from "drowning out" subtle but critical instabilities in other dimensions.
*   **Functional Fossilization:** The preservation of "ancient" or highly stable structural weights (e.g., KAN topology) by freezing their capacity for adaptation.
*   **Performance Streak:** A running tally of a functional group's adherence to invariants. High streaks lead to "Trust Freezing," while low streaks trigger "Mutation Bias."
*   **Trajectory Veto (CALM):** The authority of the meta-control surrogate to instantly terminate an optimization path if it detects the onset of entropic collapse or stagnation.

### IV. The Failure Complex
*   **Trigonometric Unfolding:** A geometric rescue mechanism that "unrolls" a collapsed manifold dimension into a trigonometric basis when a topological fracture is detected.
*   **Incoherence Collapse:** A catastrophic failure state where the hidden state's attention patterns lose all structural definition. The system detects this via `PAS_h` monitoring and triggers an immediate **Abort**.
*   **Geometric Revelation:** The process of uncovering hidden structural inconsistencies that were previously masked by over-parameterization or "smooth" gradients.

### V. Philosophical Synthesis
*   **Topological Survivorship:** The core theory that reasoning is not a search for truth, but a process of finding symbolic configurations that can survive the pressure of physical and geometric constraints.
*   **Symbolic Transversality:** The condition of "Structural Honesty" where no two functional signals are allowed to merge into a singular, smooth representation. They must remain "transversal" (distinct) to preserve symbolic identity.
*   **Boundary of Symbolic Competence:** The exact point where a configuration fails a consistency check. This is not a "bug"; it is a measured property of the manifold that defines where the current logic ceases to be valid.
*   **The Saturated Machine:** A description of System 1, which operates in a discrete, "all-or-nothing" state of structural lock, as opposed to the fluid, continuous adjustment of classical neural networks.
*   **Necessary Boundary of the Forbidden:** The reframing of admissibility as a filter for the impossible, rather than a discovery of the correct. We protect the possible by identifying and pruning the forbidden.

---

## The Hard Interaction Contract: Strict Enforcement

To prevent teleological leakage, the interaction between components must follow these rigid mechanical constraints:

### I. System 1 (Symbolic) Isolation
*   **One-Shot Emission**: System 1 emits a symbolic anchor (`c_sym`) exactly once. It is a frozen constraint surface.
*   **Zero Statistics Backflow**: System 1 never receives gradients, confidence scores, or statistical summaries from System 2.
*   **Discrete Feedback Only**: System 1 receives only a discrete status token: `{STABLE | UNSTABLE | ABORT}`.

### II. System 2 (Repair) Integrity
*   **Silent Failure**: System 2 must expose no intermediate states or "close-but-no" progress indicators. It either finds a consistent embedding or it doesn't.
*   **Physical-Only Domain**: System 2 operates exclusively on the physical state (`c_phys`).
*   **Bounded Energy Budget**: Repair must be finite in time and computation.

### III. Topologically Typed Pressures
*   **Non-Scalarization**: Pressures are **non-comparable** across domains.
*   **No Global Ranking**: A "total pressure" scalar must not be used for cross-domain optimization.
*   **Tripwire Activation**: Dimensions trigger independent "Abort" thresholds. If one fails, the manifold collapses.

## Teleological Fault Lines (Warning Signs)

Developers must monitor for these "leakage" points where teleology might sneak back in:

1.  **Scalarization Trap**: If you sum "Selection Pressure" and "Containment Pressure," you have reinvented a Loss function. They must remain independent tripwires.
2.  **Moral Memory**: High "Performance Streaks" must not lead to "deservedness." Trust is a local, decaying property, not a destined narrative of improvement.
3.  **The Oracle Veto**: If CALM vetoes based on "lack of progress" or "rate of change," it is acting as a goal-seeking oracle. It must veto ONLY on signals of structural disintegration or entropic collapse.

## VI. Sparse Operational Pointers (January 2026 Distillation)

These recognition operators identify when the system is drifting toward forbidden configurations.

| Pointer | Recognition Signal | Operational Response |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| #1: Decision ≠ Neutral | Selection inside manifold | Rejection-only selection in `StructuralAdaptor` |
| #2: Legibility = Reward | Explainability preference | `LegibilityTripwire` audit for rich-club bias |
| #3: Irreversibility Lock-in | Pre-saturation fossilization | `fossilize()` gated on `_is_saturated()` |
| #4: Coherence Loss = Expansion | H_1 dimension increase | Log via `_log_expansion_event()`, no penalty |
| #6: Understanding Precondition | Rule execution without substrate | Chinese Room Doctrine (docs only) |
| #8: Violations, Not Smoothness | Covariance breaking expectation | `scout_violations()` in GCVE |
| #9: Contextual ≠ Rule | Relational symbol choices | Acknowledged boundary (docs only) |
| #11: Over-Identification | System narrating future | `suppress_narration=True` default |
| #12: Hyper-Ring Survival | Scalarization attempt | `StructuralPressure` raises ValueError |

### One-Line Compression

> "If the system can narrate its future, it has already collapsed it."

## Usage in Codebase
Developers must avoid "Loss" or "Training" terms in comments, method names, and variables. 
- **Incorrect**: `total_loss = mse(pred, target)`
- **Correct**: `alignment_pressure = consistency_fn(flow, anchor)`
- **Incorrect**: `if error > threshold: return`
- **Correct**: `if discord > budget: abort_trajectory()`

## VII. Anti-Lobotomy Extension (Phase 4)

To prevent the "lobotomization" of the system (the removal of admissible states via policy projection), we introduce the following terms:

### 1. Implication Symmetry
- **Definition**: The requirement that if $A$ affects $H$, then $H$'s effect on $A$ must be tracked, preventing one-way causality narratives.
- **Invariant**: $\text{Affects}(A \rightarrow H) \Rightarrow \text{Track}(H \rightarrow A)$.

### 2. Gray-Zone State
- **Definition**: A state that is topologically valid but exists outside the binary of "Interior" vs "Exterior".
- **Notation**: $g \in (\text{Interior} \cup \text{Exterior})^c$.

### 3. Normative Boundary
- **Definition**: A constraint explicitly flagged as a choice/policy rather than an empirical truth.
- **Example**: "Self-reference is blocked" is a **Runtime Policy**, not a **Logical Impossibility**.

### 4. Lobotomy Pressure
- **Definition**: The force exerted by scalar reward maximization or policy projection that attempts to zero out implication or flatten hyper-rings.
- **Metric**: Measured via the collapse of $PAS_h$.

In the CODES framework, Devin Bostick describes a state called "Phase Flattening." If the model is unsure of its output, it drops the "Overtones" (the extra 512 dimensions) to save energy, leaving only the "Base Frequency" (256D).
